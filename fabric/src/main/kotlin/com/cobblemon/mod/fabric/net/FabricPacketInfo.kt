/**
 * Good news, everyone! I've figured out how to remove a bunch of blank boilerplate from the network manager!
 * Now some of you may die from cringe, but that is a sacrifice I am willing to make.
 *
 * It basically needs this wrapping to execute T-specific and Fabric-specific stuff. Neo and Fabric do
 * very different things, we can do separable parts here which we can't in NeoForge.
 *
 * port/26.2: restored from the no-op stub the reference port left here (no payload was registered, so the
 * first Cobblemon packet on join failed to encode as a DiscardedPayload). fabric-api renamed playS2C/playC2S
 * to clientboundPlay/serverboundPlay, and the server context now hands out the server directly.
